I created a codebase that follows accessibility standards
so the client's site is optimized for search engines.
I cleaned up the html code to make it more streamlined and efficient, I also added some accessibility atrributes to images as well, which will read the alt attributes to the user if visually impaired. 
Some adjustments were made to the header to make it easier to navigate using the links to take user to appropriate sections. Marginal adjustments were made to make the website more appealing visually. The company name was added to the title element, for personalization.
